Homework Assignment 3 in Grad School - Python, R, and SAS
This was a homework assignment that I had in graduate school in which I used Python, R, and SAS in the same assignment. 

Python is not prerequisite knowledge for this statistics program. Using sympy and numpy was essential to generate polynomials with extremely large coefficients. I then had to use R to find the roots of these polynomials.
